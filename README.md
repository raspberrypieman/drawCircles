# drawCircles
Draw random circles around fixed invisible shapes
Inspired by the beautifully hand-drawn art by Amy Mather @MiniGirlGeek

As I am not an artist, I thought I would try to simulate her art using code, but 
have failed miserably, but it was fun trying.

I tried using Python initially, but could not find a simple way to get the colour of a single pixel at x,y coordinates.
So here is my attempt at using HTML5 canvas.

I invite anyone to improve my code or start again in any language.
